<h1>Project Proposal - Evacuation Least Cost Path App</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Natural and human caused disasters often occur in areas that do not have
 adequate or detailed evacuation or safety plans. For example, when man-made
 dams or levees fail, catastrophic damage can occur very rapidly. 
 The 1976 Teton Dam failure in Idaho is a perfect example of this. 
 After efforts to plug the seepage that had started to develop, the 
 broke and released a wall of water flowing at more than a million cubic 
 feet per second, according to the Bureau of Reclamation’s website1. The 
 website explains, “the communities of Sugar City, Rexburg, and Wilford 
 were battered by the trees, houses, cattle and cars carried by the 
 floodwaters,” and 11 people lost their lives. 

It was this event that prompted the Bureau’s “Dam Safety” program to be 
created. To aid in the development of this and other programs aimed at 
local emergency preparation, the Evacuation Least Cost Path (ELCP) App 
will be created. This app allows the user to first identify the hazard 
area that is likely to be affected, using criterion that the user inputs. 
For example, the hazard area that results from flooding due to natural 
causes can be defined by a certain water level that the flood rises to, 
whereas flooding due to a dam failure may be defined from the amount of 
water released by the dam. Once a hazard area is identified, the app 
identifies the most efficient evacuation route for areas within the 
affected area.

This app will greatly aid in emergency preparation efforts for local, 
state, and national agencies and governments. It simplifies the process 
for determining areas at risk and provides a valuable tool to aid in 
defining evacuation efforts. Ultimately, the effectiveness of this app may 
be instrumental in preserving human lives.</p>
